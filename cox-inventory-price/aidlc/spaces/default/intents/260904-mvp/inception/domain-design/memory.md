## Interpretations
<!-- example: 2026-05-29T10:14:32Z — chose REST over GraphQL; the consuming team only needs CRUD, revisit if subscriptions land -->
- 2026-09-08T16:50:00Z — Q1 A means one new mapper; the four existing FRE modules are catalogued as call sites, not as new adapter components.

## Deviations
<!-- example: 2026-05-29T10:14:32Z — skipped the optional caching layer the stage prose suggested; the dataset is small enough that it adds risk -->

## Tradeoffs
<!-- example: 2026-05-29T10:14:32Z — picked TDD over BDD this run; the team is unit-first and the domain is well-understood -->
- 2026-09-08T16:50:00Z — Shared mapper plus existing call sites over four rule copies or four new adapters, so hide/fallback/copy cannot drift.

## Open questions
<!-- example: 2026-05-29T10:14:32Z — confirm the retention window with compliance before the next stage hardens the schema -->
- 2026-09-08T16:50:00Z — Functional Design still needs an explicit copy variant so hero range and starting at {low} do not share one return shape (advisory R-01).
