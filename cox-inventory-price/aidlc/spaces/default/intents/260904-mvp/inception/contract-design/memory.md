## Interpretations
<!-- example: 2026-05-29T10:14:32Z — chose REST over GraphQL; the consuming team only needs CRUD, revisit if subscriptions land -->
- 2026-09-08T17:47:13Z — Formal contracts cover only the four placement→mapper edges; GraphQL marketplace selection stays on each placement query file and is not a separate contract (Q1 A).

## Deviations
<!-- example: 2026-05-29T10:14:32Z — skipped the optional caching layer the stage prose suggested; the dataset is small enough that it adds risk -->

## Tradeoffs
<!-- example: 2026-05-29T10:14:32Z — picked TDD over BDD this run; the team is unit-first and the domain is well-understood -->
- 2026-09-08T17:47:13Z — Spec is a shared-schema / TypeScript-style function, not OpenAPI, because units stay in-process (Q2 A). Advisory R-01 notes formatDollars still needs a typed signature before Construction.

## Open questions
<!-- example: 2026-05-29T10:14:32Z — confirm the retention window with compliance before the next stage hardens the schema -->
